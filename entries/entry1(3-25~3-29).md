### <strong>Choosing a Topic</strong>

<p>So I was planning to do something a bit challenging and at the same time "doable",going through Google,hearing suggestions from classmate and even tinkering with CodeAcademy lessons.
I decided to choose C# as my independent study topic.

</p>

### <strong>What is C#?</strong>

<p>C# can be used to make interactive websites, mobile apps, video games, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), desktop applications, and back-end services â€“ just to name a few.(Codecademy) When I was tinkering with
CodeAcademy,I was suprised to find out that Stack Overflow were built with frameworks that can be run with C#(Unity an ASP.NET). 

### <strong>Hello World!</strong>

    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!") 
    
This remain of me **Console.log**, something we've learn in the past.</p>
 

<p>
    C#
    
    Console.WriteLine("How old are you?");
    string input = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine($"You are {input} years old!");
    
Ruby
    
    puts "how old are you?";
    user_string = gets.chomp;
    puts "You are #{user_string} years old!";

Learning the new way of reading user input instead of **gets.chomp** ,using the string given by the user return it in console<br>

    dotnet run
   
is a way of to run interactive code in C#. I guess this will be my new **"Shotgun -p $PORT -o $IP"**

### <strong>Comments</strong>


    /* Pick a random number from 1 to 10 */
    Randomnum1-10();
    
    //old code
    new code
    
There is two types of comments one is for explainning the code and one is for lgnoring a lone of code    
    

After tinkering with CodeAcademy a bit, I was curious to find out what I should make later on, maybe read about Unity,and make somethin with that? 

</p>

### <strong>Takeaways</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Seeing some code for C#,making connection with Ruby and Javascript. Regonizing the code structure are similar to we I've learn in the past</li>
     <li>Learn how to read C# the "proper" way lol, at firs I was thinking C hashtag be It was C sharp</li>
</ul>
