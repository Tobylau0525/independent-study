# Entry-03-learning the fundamentals of Unity
<br>

Ugh.....so what did I do this week?I watch video on Youtube about Unity...then what?

<h4>I've learn all of these awesome things from the video,now what?</h4>


<p>For this week I focus a lot on the motion of the object and the physics,to do this I've tinker with the tutorial inside of Unity </p>



<br>
<h3>What's what in Unity?</h3>
<img src="window.jpg" alt="window of unity" height="42" width="42">
<p>Unity is a game engine that can be used to create three-dimensional and two-dimensional games,here we have the Scene view at the top,it's like the controller in the MVC.We can arrange object the thing we want</p>
<p>Next is the game view where we see what the player see while they "play".</p>

<h3>What about the "phyiscs"?</h3>

<img src="inspector.jpg" alt="inspector" height="42" width="42">

<p>Here we can see the inspector window,you can edit the 'physics' of the object,the mass,the grravity...making it more realistic.</p>

<p>The Hierarchy window show us everything in the scene view,just a list for us to keep track what object should be in the view.</p>


<h1>Takeaways</h1>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>Always</strong> try out something you've learn,I try out what I've learn and I realize,I wasn't doing something right...so always try things out don't just be like "I've watch this,I'm fine..."</li>
  <li>Have notes for the things we've learn everyday,the reason is we will most likely to forget if we don't have some sort of notes to remind ourselves the little "a-ha" moment.</li>
  
</ol>

<h1>Plan for this week</h1>
<ol>
  <li> Finish up the tutorial and decide what I will make for my independent study.</li>
 
</ol>

<h1>Things I've learn this week</h1>
<ol>
  <li>change how object behave(physically)</li>
  <li>How to select object in the scene view and Hierarchy window</li>
  <li>using inspector window to add componets to object</li>
</ol>
