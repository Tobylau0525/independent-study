# Entry-06-Control and Rolling
<br>

So what did I do last week for my independent study? I've been facing countless issue when I try to work my way toward the end product, I've picked up my work from last week, and work on the movement for the bowling ball. So far I'm having trouble to make it move the way I want.

<h4>I've been thinking of ways I could set the sphere up, So It will not only look just like(or close) how it should be "acting" in real life and also move just like A NORMAL BALL! CAN YOU JUST ROLL LIKE A NORMAL BALL?</h4>


<h3>Working on the the "whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat" why are you rotating like this</h3>

<h5>So before the week, I've overcome one of the most important issue which is the "checking whether or not if objects had a collision with the bowling ball" issue, so I was like nice, that's no way there's something harder than this or should raise an issue</h5>
<h5>I was so <strong>WRONG</strong> about this.....like.....come on......I'm trying to make more progress, and a freaking ball is stopping me from making more progress, because <strong>IT'S NOT DOING WHAT IT"S SUPPOSE TO</strong></h5>
<h5> Start the sceen->control the ball with wsad or arrow->trys to hit the other object and see what will hapeen-> rotate in the air like a moon-> flies off the platform</h5>

<h3>Yea, I forgot to show the code for <strong>Only</strong>cotrolling the ball</h3>

```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class rolling : MonoBehaviour {
    
    public float speed = 1.5;
    private Rigidbody rb;
    
    void Start () {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }
    
    void FixedUpdate () {
    float movementHorizontal = input.GetAxis ("Horizontal")    
    float movementVertical = input.GetAxis ("Vertical")    
        
    Vector3 movement = new Vector3 (movementHorizontal,0.0f, movementVertical)    
        
    rb.AddForce(movement * speed)    
    }
    
    
}

```

<p>To be honest, these issues are dragging me down to the point where I question myself, how long is it going to take for me to find the solution this time... and when will I get to my end product...</p>

<p>I was thinking if I could add more physics to the sphere so It can just act like a ball in real life</p>

<h1>Next step</h1>
<ol>
  <li>finding if It's possible to add rotate movement to the sphere so It can roll like a normal ball</li>
  <li>plan out the layout for the level</li>
</ol>

<h1>Takeaways</h1>
<ol>
  <li> Be prepare to be challenge with another issue after you've overcome one, because there's always one waiting at the turn trying to hit you hard after you've come up with something that you're not sure about</li>
  
</ol>
